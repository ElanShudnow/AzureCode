# AzurePS
A place to share all the Azure PowerShell Scripts I am writing.

| Script | Description | Link |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| VMSKURegionAvailability | This PowerShell Script was to take a list of Virtual Machine SKUs and Regions from a CSV and get a list of what Virtual Machine SKUs are supported in the specified Regions.  This script will provide output of the results in both the PowerShell Console as well as a CSV output in the same directory the script is executed from. | [Link](https://github.com/ElanShudnow/AzurePS/tree/main/VMSKURegionAvailability) |
